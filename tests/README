Instructions for running unit tests:

These tests are set up to run on at least two
origins. For example, you could have the vTPM on 
http://localhost, and tests/index.html on a 
file:// URL.

You will also need vtpm_const.js, vtpm_user.js, 
and add_event_listener.js on the same origin as 
tests/index.html. By default, the tests look 
for these Javascript files in a src directory 
one directory above tests/index.html. If this 
is not the case in your setup, then update the 
script tag sources at the top of tests/index.html.

If you want to run tests that involve the key pair same origin
policy, then you need to run tests/setup.html on an origin
other than the origin that runs tests/index.html. For example,
you can run unit_tests/setup.html on http://localhost:8080.
The setup.html origin will also require add_event_listener.js, 
vtpm_user.js, and vtpm_const.js. As with tests/index.html,
tests/setup.html assumes by default that these Javascript files 
are in src/ one directory above setup.html. Navigate to setup.html 
in a web browser. The output will be a public key, which you 
should copy and paste into OTHER_ORIGIN_PK near the top of 
tests/index.html.

You can run tests/index.html in a web browser to see the
test results.

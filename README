### HTML5 Crypto API ###
########################

This project provides crypto operations in Javascript to a web application. 
The crypto operations are implemented in pure HTML5 and Javascript by a 
"virtual TPM" (VTPM), which is an iframe hosted on a separate, trusted 
origin from the application. The origin separation of the VTPM from the 
application ensures that a compromised application cannot leak the VTPM 
secret key.

The VTPM master key pair is currently stored in localStorage, so the 
key pair is tied to the user's browser and machine.

Documentation for the API can be found at the end of this document.

INSTALLING A VTPM:

To run a vTPM, copy the following src/ files to a server (all files should 
be in the same directory):

- vtpm.html (displayed in an iframe, includes the other scripts)
- vtpm.js (handles messages from the application to perform crypto operations)
- vtpm_const.js (defines constants used in messages between frames)
- vtpm_worker.js (does expensive crypto operations and sends results to vtpm.js)
- vtpm_worker.html (included in an iframe to simulate a Worker in older browsers)
- sjcl.js (underlying cryptographic library, with a few small modifications from
the original)
- add_event_listener.js (defines addEventListener for browsers that don't 
already implement it)

Before going further, src/vtpm_user.js needs to be updated to point to your VTPM: 
change VTPM_ORIGIN and VTPM_SRC near the top of the file to be the origin and URL 
of vtpm.html on your VTPM server.

Even for testing purposes, the above VTPM files can NOT be hosted on a file:// URL 
because file:// URLs do not have access to localStorage.

CHECK THAT THE VTPM WORKS:

check.html runs through basic operations to make sure that everything is set up 
correctly. To run check.html:
- On another origin (not your vtpm's origin), copy check.html, src/vtpm_const.js, 
src/add_event_listener.js, and src/vtpm_user.js. You can run these files locally 
on a file:// URL if you want. check.html assumes that the rest of the files are 
in a src subdirectory; if this is not the case, then change the script tag sources 
at the top of check.html.
- Update VTPM_ORIGIN and VTPM_SRC near the top of src/vtpm_user.js to point to your 
VTPM's origin and the URL to vtpm.html.
- Navigate to check.html in a web browser. You will be prompted via the secure 
UI for two signatures, one signcryption, and a public key certification. If you
eventually end up with a "Done!" message and no JS errors, things are looking 
good.

TESTING:

tests/index.html contains some more VTPM tests. To run these tests:
- One of the tests requires a key from a different origin than the VTPM and the 
tests. To set up this key, copy tests/setup.html, src/vtpm_const.js, 
src/add_event_listener.js, and src/vtpm_user.js to a third origin (not the one 
where you're running check.html, and not the one where you're running the vTPM). 
Update VTPM_ORIGIN and VTPM_SRC of vtpm_user.js to point to your vtpm. Navigate 
to setup.html in a web browser. Copy and paste the public key into 
OTHER_ORIGIN_PK near the top of tests/index.html.
- Create a tests directory in the directory where you put check.html, and
copy tests/index.html into that directory.
- Navigate to tests/index.html in a web browser. You should see all green
pass messages and no JS errors. If you skipped the first step, then one test
should fail ("Certify and verify a public key from another origin").

Further instructions can be found in tests/README.

DEMOS:

The demos/ directory contains a Django project with two applications meant
to demonstrate some use cases of the API. The demos/bank application allows
users of the "bank" to transfer money to each other and to sign these transfers.
The demos/safemsg application allows users to send messages to each other,
encrypted with public keys that the server stores, where the messages are
encrypted and decrypted in the browser. The safemsg application requires a bit
more of a complex design to make it into an actual compelling use case, but
it should serve as a starting point for designing such an application. More
details about how to run these demos and what design changes would be needed
to strengthen the safemsg application are in demos/README.txt.

VTPM DESIGN:

The vTPM is an iframe embedded in check.html. The page using a vTPM 
(for example, the check.html demo page) is called the vTPM user.
The vTPM user communicates with the vTPM via the postMessage API.

To make an API call, the vTPM user (check.html) calls a window.crypto function 
and specifies a callback. All API functions are performed asynchronously. 
vtpm_user.js defines the window.crypto functions. Each window.crypto function 
sends a message to the VTPM via a postMessage call. vtpm_user.js also defines 
a handler for received messages. Each message received from
postMessage call. vtpm_user.js also defines a handler for received 
messages. The statuses used in the messages are defined in vtpm_const.js.

The VTPM is initialized on the first API call. This involves generating the 
VTPM master key or loading it up if it is already generated. Upon 
initialization the VTPM also spawns a Worker thread to run vtpm_worker.js. 
The VTPM communicates with its Worker thread via postMessage similarly to 
how the VTPM user communicates with the VTPM.

As an example, here's what happens when check.html calls 
window.crypto.encrypt:
1.) vtpm_user.js posts an encrypt message with the plaintext to the vTPM 
(vtpm.js).
2.) vtpm.js parses the received message. If the worker will need any data
from localStorage to perform the computation, vtpm.js retrieves it and
adds it to the arguments it received from vtpm_user.js. (For encryption,
no localStorage data is needed, but for example, a decrypt() call requires
the blob of data associated with the public key in localStorage.)
3.) vtpm.js constructs an encrypt message whose arguments include
the arguments it received from vtpm_user.js as well as any necessary
localStorage data. vtpm.js posts this message to the worker.
4.) The worker receives the message, parses it, performs the encryption,
and constructs a message with the result to vtpm.js.
5.) vtpm.js receives the message from the worker and parses it. If any data
from the result needs to be stored in localStorage, vtpm.js does it before
passing the result back to vtpm_user.js.
6.) vtpm.js constructs a message with the resulting ciphertext and posts it 
to vtpm_user.js.
7.) vtpm_user.js receives the message, parses out the ciphertext, and calls
the callback specified in the argument to window.crypto.encrypt.


API DOCUMENTATION

Secure UI:
The VTPM fires a secureUIVisible event when the secure UI is shown (for 
example, to ask for permission to sign some data), and a secureUIInvisible 
event when the secure UI is hidden (for example, when the signature is 
approved or denied). These events can be used by the VTPM user to show or
hide the elements that contain the VTPM.


window.crypto.generatePolicy(startDate, endDate, keyUsage, callback)
-----
Generates a policy that can be passed to window.crypto.generateKeyPair. 
startDate and endDate are Javascript Date objects that specify a validity 
window for the keypair. keyUsage specifies what operations (encryption, 
signing, certifying other keys) the keypair is allowed to perform, and 
whether the user must approve signatures via secure UI. keyUsage flags are 
defined in vtpmKeyPolicy in vtpm_const.js.

The argument to callback is a JSON object that represents the policy.

window.crypto.generateKeyPair(policy, callback)
-----
Generates a public/private key pair with the given policy.

The argument to callback is a public key which serves as an identifier 
for the key pair. The public key can be passed into calls to 
encrypt/decrypt, sign/verify, etc. to perform crypto operations.

window.crypto.getPolicy(pk, callback)
-----
Retrieves the policy associated with the given public key.

The argument to callback is the policy object.

window.crypto.getWrappedKeyPair(pk, callback)
-----
Retrieves the keypair that pk specifies. The keypair includes the secret 
key and associated policy. The policy is signed with the vTPM master key,
and the secret key is encrypted and signed with the master key.

The argument to callback is an object that contained the wrapped keypair 
and the associated public key. 
The wrappedSk property of this object can be passed to 
window.crypto.installKeyPair to import the keypair into the vTPM.

window.crypto.evictKeyPair(pk, callback)
-----
Removes the keypair specified by pk from the vTPM's localStorage.

callback takes no arguments.

window.crypto.installKeyPair(pk, wrappedSk, callback)
-----
Installs the given keypair in the vTPM, provided that the secret key is 
correctly wrapped in the vTPM's msater key.

callback takes no arguments.

window.crypto.encrypt(pk, data, callback)
-----
data is a string. Encrypts data under the given public key.

The argument to callback is a ciphertext object that can be passed 
to window.crypto.decrypt, along with pk, to decrypt.

window.crypto.decrypt(pk, ciphertext, callback)
-----
Decrypts the given ciphertext with the secret key associated with 
pk.

The argument to callback is an object pt. pt.valid indicates whether 
the decryption was successful, and pt.data contains the plaintext string.

window.crypto.sign(pk, data, callback)
-----
Uses the secret key associated with pk to sign the data. data is a string.

The argument to callback is a JSON object sig. sig.data contains the actual 
signature. Pass sig.data to window.crypto.verify to verify a signature.
(Note: this should be changed so that verify takes the whole sig object,
not sig.data.)

window.crypto.verify(pk, signature, data, callback)
-----
Verifies that signature is valid for the public key pk on the string data.

The callback takes a single boolean argument, which is true if the signature 
was valid.

window.crypto.signcrypt(rpk, spk, data, callback)
-----
Signcrypts the string data. The secret key associated with spk is used for 
signing, and the public key rpk is used for encrypting.

The argument to callback is a ciphertext object, which can be passed to
window.crypto.verifydecrypt.

window.crypto.verifydecrypt(rpk, spk, ct, callback)
-----
Verifies and decrypts the ciphertext object ct. The secret key associated 
with rpk is used for decrypting, and the public key spk for verifying.

The argument to callback is a string plaintext. The string is empty if
the decryption or verification failed.
(Note: this needs to be made consistent with window.crypto.decrypt, 
where the plaintext object has a valid field.)

window.crypto.certifyPublicKey(signingPk, targetPk, callbac, 
  [secureUIConfirm, secureUIDeny])
-----
Uses signingPk to certify targetPk. Requires secure UI approval from the 
user. The optional arguments secureUIConfirm and secureUIDeny are messages 
to show to the user in the secure UI to confirm or deny the certification. 
Use "{0}" or "{1}" in these messages as placeholders for the origins of the 
signing and target keys.

The argument to callback is a certificate object. This object can be passed 
to window.crypto.verifyPublicKeyCert for verification.

window.crypto.verifyPublicKeyCert(verifyPk, targetPk, cert, callback)
-----
Uses verifyPk to verify the certificate for targetPk.

The argument to callback is a boolean value indicating whether the 
certificate verified.

window.crypto.setVTPMParent(elem)
-----
Relocates the VTPM to be a child of the given DOM element. Used for placing 
the secure UI. (For example, elem might be a div that floats at the top of 
the page and which is only visible when the user page receives a 
secureUIVisible event.)

This method can ONLY be called before any other operations.

window.crypto.getVTPM()
-----
Returns a reference to the VTPM iframe.
